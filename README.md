# ArUco Marker Detection

This project demonstrates the detection and pose estimation of ArUco markers using OpenCV. ArUco markers are widely used in computer vision applications, such as camera calibration, augmented reality, and robotics.

## Files

- `ArucoModule.py`: Contains the main code for detecting ArUco markers and estimating their poses.
- `myNewProject.py`: Provides examples and additional functionalities related to the project.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV 4.x
- NumPy

You can install the required packages using the following command:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
